# Wethenew Monitor
**UPDATE**: WTN added cloudflare protection, I will not opensourcing how to solve it, you can still use the code as reference
This is a simple python script to monitor for new asks for sneakers by Wethenew on their website.
## Setup
In **requirements.txt** you can find all the non-native dependencies that are necessary.
The script requires also a Discord Webhook and Bot to function.
Please refer to https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro for info on that.

The **PID** can be found directly in the shoe's URL
